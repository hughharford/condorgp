# Overall approach to ensure scientific rigour

## Suggested approaches
  - from ref: docs/research/22 07 ___ jk 2015 Berutich et all __ robust_ESWA_2016_ps.pdf
  1. Always compare with Buy & Hold strategy
  2. Use a random sampling method that doesn't require human input
  3. Aim for a single algorithm solution that is robust
  4. Consider robustness vs:
     1. Market changes
     2. Generalisability
  5. Ensure a sight-unseen validation dataset for reliable test
     1. Avoid data leakage

## Other notes
  1. Generalisability is key
