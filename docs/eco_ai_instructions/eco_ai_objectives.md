# ECO AI OBJECTIVES

## This isn't necessarily a full answer or a sensible idea in a number of ways
## BUT:

## Objectives

+ use old computers and laptops that are essentially obselete
+ before recycling them, give them as full a use as plausible
+ repurpose them using ubuntu servers
+ use cloud computing 'on premises' such as AWS to control and run each
+ hopefully (tbc on rates with e.g. AWS) reduce costs considerably
