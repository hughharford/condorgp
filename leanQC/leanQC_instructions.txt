1. Need to clone Lean repo:
  git clone git@github.com:QuantConnect/Lean.git
  >> suggest strongly for path-hell reasons that this git clone command is
  run two folders 'back', i.e. ../../ from the base of condorgp repo

2. Build the container for LeanFoundation
  sudo docker build -f DockerfileLeanFoundation .

  >> n.b. you will need to be in the file location for the
    docker file DockerfileLeanFoundation, i.e. Lean
  >> n.b. this will take a seriously long time! circa 1 hour or so. Once
    the image is built, it can be used repeatedly, so fine provided it works.

3. Build the subsequent docker for Lean, using the LeanFoundation image


NOTES:
A. See /previous folder, hsth's 2020 workings to get the LeanFoundation
    and other builds, docker folder mounting etc to work.
B. See also .bat, .cfg and .sh in this folder, all examples from 2020
    and files expected in the Lean repo as previous.
    These were used to run dockers, build etc on various systems and with
    various configurations
