1. Need to clone Lean repo:
  git clone git@github.com:QuantConnect/Lean.git
  >> suggest strongly for path-hell reasons that this git clone command is
  run two folders 'back', i.e. ../../ from the base of condorgp repo

2. Build the container for LeanFoundation
  sudo docker build -f DockerfileLeanFoundation -t lean:foundation .

  >> n.b. you will need to be in the file location for the
    docker file DockerfileLeanFoundation, i.e. Lean
  >> n.b. this will take a seriously long time! circa 1 hour or so. Once
    the image is built, it can be used repeatedly, so fine provided it works.
  >> expected image size of 13.1gb
  >> skip this build, if downloading 13gb is your preference (see 4. below)

3. Install Lean
  >> Install dotnet5:
      https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux
     Or pick your os etc

    # @@@ see Lean/Readme.md
    # for linux or CI builds, the script file runs nicely:
    leanQC/installation/dotnet-install.sh
    # Ran:
    #     sudo bash dotnet-install.sh -c Current
    # BUT failed to install dotnet
    # Trying snap (this won't work with WSL)
    sudo snap install dotnet-sdk --classic --channel=6.0
    # .zshrc now recognises 'dotnet'

  >> then install:
    dotnet build QuantConnect.Lean.sln
    # @@@@@@@                         NB. run in the Lean root folder
  >> took 1m23s, with 0 errors, but 9434 warnings. fun.


4. Build the subsequent docker for Lean, using the LeanFoundation image
  >> Navigate to ../../QuantConnect/Lean
  >> Edit the cloned Dockerfile found there:
        FROM lean:foundation
        # FROM quantconnect/lean:foundation
        # @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
        # the commented line above is the original, which will download
        # the shorter line will look to build from local Docker image
  >> run:
    sudo docker build . -t lean:latest

  >>>> but this fails... interesting. Needs the following adjustment to build
    # adjusted from line 23 in the Dockerfile to:
    # COPY ./DataLibraries /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    # COPY ./AlphaStreams/QuantConnect.AlphaStream/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Launcher/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Optimizer.Launcher/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Optimizer.Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Report/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Report/bin/Debug/

  # @@@ the above builds correctly (and quickly) ___needs a test run!

NOTES:
A. See /previous folder, hsth's 2020 workings to get the LeanFoundation
    and other builds, docker folder mounting etc to work.
B. See also .bat, .cfg and .sh in this folder, all examples from 2020
    and files expected in the Lean repo as previous.
    These were used to run dockers, build etc on various systems and with
    various configurations
