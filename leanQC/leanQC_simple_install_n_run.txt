# much simpler way of running things:
# just:

pip install lean

in the lean directory, run
lean init
# this will download data etc

# gave the following output:
- lean.json contains the configuration used when running the LEAN engine locally
- data/ contains the data that is used when running the LEAN engine locally

The following documentation pages may be useful:
- Setting up local autocomplete: https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/projects/autocomplete
- Synchronizing projects with the cloud:
https://www.lean.io/docs/lean-cli/projects/cloud-synchronization

Here are some commands to get you going:
- Run `lean create-project "My Project"` to create a new project with starter code
- Run `lean cloud pull` to download all your QuantConnect projects to your local drive
- Run `lean backtest "My Project"` to backtest a project locally with the data in data/

will need to have followed the detail in
leanQC_instructions.txt, as lean expects the docker image
It will pull it from the cloud if you haven't built

That only the following .json files make any impact:

>> look for the source of definition of: dataFolder
