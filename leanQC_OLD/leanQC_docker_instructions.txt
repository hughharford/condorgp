1. Need to clone Lean repo:
  git clone git@github.com:QuantConnect/Lean.git
  >> suggest strongly for path-hell reasons that this git clone command is
  run one folder 'back', i.e. alongside the condorgp repo

2. Build the container for LeanFoundation
  sudo docker build -f DockerfileLeanFoundation -t quantconnect/lean:foundation .

  >> n.b. you will need to be in the file location for the
    docker file DockerfileLeanFoundation, i.e. Lean
  >> n.b. this will take a seriously long time! circa 1 hour or so. Once
    the image is built, it can be used repeatedly, so fine provided it works.
  >> expected image size of 13.1gb
  >> skip this build, if downloading 13gb is your preference (see 4. below)

3. Install Lean
  >> Install dotnet5:
      https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux
     Or pick your os etc

    # @@@ see Lean/Readme.md
    # for linux or CI builds, the script file runs nicely:
    leanQC/installation/dotnet-install.sh
    # Ran:
    #     sudo bash leanQC/installation/dotnet-install.sh/dotnet-install.sh -c Current
    # BUT failed to install dotnet
    # Trying snap (this won't work with WSL)
    sudo snap install dotnet-sdk --classic --channel=6.0
    # .zshrc now recognises 'dotnet'

  >> then install:
    dotnet build QuantConnect.Lean.sln
    # @@@@@@@                         NB. run in the Lean root folder
  >> took 1m23s, with 0 errors, but 9434 warnings. fun.


4. Build the subsequent docker for Lean, using the LeanFoundation image
***********************************
  >> Navigate to Lean/
  >> run:
    sudo docker build . -t quantconnect/lean:latest
    # quantconnect/lean:latest

  >> likely have errors:
  >>> so
      Edit the cloned Dockerfile found there:

  >>>> Needs the following adjustment to build
    # adjusted from line 23 in the Dockerfile to:
    # i.e. comment out 2 lines, and leave 3 lines:

    # COPY ./DataLibraries /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    # COPY ./AlphaStreams/QuantConnect.AlphaStream/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Launcher/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Optimizer.Launcher/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Optimizer.Launcher/bin/Debug/
    COPY ./Report/bin/Debug/ /Lean/Report/bin/Debug/

  ###
  #
  # @@@ the above builds correctly (and quickly)
  #

5. Test run of the lean_runner.py:
***********************************
    from condorgp.lean_runner import RunLean
    r = RunLean()
    r.run_lean_via_CLI()

6. Test
***********************************
    See BBD tests 02-05 and probably further

7. Follow the installation instructions in
***********************************
    'leanQC_THESE_instructions.txt'
