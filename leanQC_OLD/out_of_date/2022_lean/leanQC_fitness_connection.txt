@ to connect gp run fitness functions, and have them run by Lean:
# _______________________________________________________________

1. need to output the deap func that is the compiled gp individual

2 save that output as a useful function by Lean
  ## where - paths and outputs etc
  Lean config.json (see leanQC/run_docker.sh)
    default_config_file=/home/hsth/code/hughharford/Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug/config.json

    see leanQC/lean_detail/config_json.md - this is a copy of the .json above:
    lines       note on alteration
    -----------------------------------------------
    12          algorithm class name
    15          language selection
    18-19       physical location of class

    >>@ Just adjusting those, we could feed in a specified .py

    A. Adjust to using our config
        /home/hsth/code/hughharford/condorgp/leanQC/config/config.json
        # have set to the above file in run_docker.sh
        >>>@ seems to work: test_02_lean_steps.py passes

    B. Leave fitness function alone, but change language:
        Attempt change to Python on line 15
        Alongside, uncomment line 19, comment line 18


  ## specification to Lean of our custom function
  ## requirements, e.g. top and tail or class signature etc

3 confirm this work
